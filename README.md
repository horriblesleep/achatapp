# Simple Chat App

This is a chat app I created for my portfolio. It uses Firebase authentication and database. 

# Instructions

The user logs in with their Google account and types in the their room number to gain access to the chat room. The room number is case sensitive and both users must have the exact same room number to speak to each other. Once finished speaking, either user can press sign out to leave the chat room.
